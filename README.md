# DownTime_Manufacturing

## Project Overview
This project involves designing and implementing an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to monitor and analyze downtime in the factory.  
The dashboard will integrate downtime data recorded in Excel, which includes key fields such as:

- Date  
- Product  
- Batch  
- Operator  
- Start time  
- End time  
- Duration  
- Number of stoppings  
- Total time  
- Size  

By aggregating and visualizing these data points, the dashboard aims to offer **real-time monitoring**, **in-depth trend analysis**, and **actionable insights** to drive improvements in production efficiency and maintenance practices.

## Dashboard Objectives

- **Real-Time and Historical Analysis:**  
  Present both real-time and historical views of downtime events using the provided data fields.  

- **Comprehensive Visualization:**  
  Develop detailed visualizations for each critical metric (e.g., downtime duration, number of stoppings, and total downtime).  

- **Performance Reporting:**  
  Generate dynamic reports and KPIs that highlight trends across Product, Batch, and Operator performance.  

- **Actionable Insights:**  
  Identify root causes of downtime and enable targeted maintenance and operational improvements.
