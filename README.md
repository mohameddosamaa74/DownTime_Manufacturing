# DownTime_Manufacturing
Project Overview:
This project involves designing and implementing an interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor and analyze downtime in the factory.
The dashboard will integrate downtime data recorded in Excel, which includes key fields such as date, product, batch, operator, start time, end time, duration, number of stopping, total time, and size. 
By aggregating and visualizing these data points, the dashboard aims to offer real-time monitoring, in-depth trend analysis, and actionable insights that drive improvements in production efficiency and maintenance practices.
Dashboard Objectives: 
•	Real-Time and Historical Analysis: Present both real-time and historical views of downtime events using the provided data fields. 
•	Comprehensive Visualization: Develop detailed visualizations for each critical metric (e.g., downtime duration, number of stoppings, and total downtime). 
•	Performance Reporting: Generate dynamic reports and KPIs that highlight trends across Product, Batch, and Operator performance. 
•	Actionable Insights: Identify root causes of downtime and enable targeted maintenance and operational improvements.
